 A GUIDE FOR JEWS WHO WANT TO SPREAD COMPASSION FOR GAZANS IN JEWISH INSTITUTIONS
After Oct. 7, synagogues and other Jewish institutions have broadly acknowledged the pain of the Jewish people who were killed and taken hostage, but don't always seem to express sympathy or empathy for the plight of Gazans who have suffered incredible loss.

In turn, many Jews, particularly younger generations, but many older Jews as well, feel increasingly alienated and unable to share their opinions in these institutions without facing blowback or being called a "bad Jew." 

If you're feeling this way, you're not alone. And if you are feeling alienated by your synagogue or other Jewish institutions, there are steps you can take to encourage rabbis and other Jewish leadership to verbalize compassion for Gazans from the bimah.
STEP 1: FIND YOUR PEOPLE
Find other Jews who feel the way you do at your synagogue or other Jewish organizations. You may be in the minority, but you're not alone.  There are plenty of Jews that have expressed the wish to recognize the humanity of all people, including the people of Gaza.
STEP 2: SET UP A MEETING
Get all of the people who feel like you do together to have a conversation, even if it’s just one other person. Some possible questions to discuss include:

What are your feelings about what is going on in Israel/Palestine?
What are your feelings about how the Jewish community discusses what's going on in Israel/Palestine?
How might we positively advocate to others in the synagogue toward creating a bigger tent?
How might we encourage the rabbi and/or board of directors of our synagogue to view Israel/Palestine differently?
What can we do to encourage recognition of the humanity of the people of Gaza?

STEP 3: ADVOCATE / SPEAKING UP
Take action:
Place a phone call to the rabbi, executive director, board of directors, or other leadership.
Write an email or letter to the rabbi, executive director, board of directors, or other leadership.
Schedule a meeting with the rabbi, executive director, board of directors, or other leadership, individually or as a group. There is strength in numbers, but even if you're the only one, it's still good to take action and support what you believe. One-to-one meetings are powerful.
Publish an article in a newspaper, magazine, or blog entry online.
Show up to public Jewish events and express how you feel.
Ask to speak on the record at the next board meeting of the synagogue.
Have an art event. Come together and make art about how you feel.  Share it with the world on social media or just at your home.
Hold an event such as a town hall where you invite someone who sees things from your perspective to facilitate dialogue and answer questions.
Screen an interesting movie that supports your perspective.
Invite people to show up to an event where they break into smaller groups to have a dialogue on this issue.
STEP 4: BE CREATIVE
There are endless ways to express what you believe and move the community and leaders of Jewish institutions to be compassionate for Gazans. Just as there are many ways to be Jewish, there are many ways to stand up for what is right.
STEP 5: KEEP BUILDING THAT TENT
Maintain regular meetings with your group and continue taking actions like these to create a bigger tent where Jewish institutions recognize the humanity of Gazans. Change doesn’t always come easy, but you will get out what you put in. 

Remember:
Anyone has the power to make a difference.
